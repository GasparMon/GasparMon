Hello, I'm Gaspar ðŸ‘‹

With a background in administration and professional experience as a Regional Manager, I've honed my skills in team management, coaching, and mentoring on a large scale.

Recently graduated from Henry's Fullstack Development program, I've delved into a variety of technologies including JavaScript, React, SQL, MongoDB, Socket.io, Git, and Tailwind, among others.

Driven by an insatiable curiosity for design and innovation, I thrive on tackling new challenges. My goal? To push the boundaries of my knowledge in emerging technologies and explore even more creative design approaches.

If you're in search of a technology enthusiast with a knack for creativity and an unwavering commitment to self-improvement, look no furtherâ€”I'm your ideal candidate!
